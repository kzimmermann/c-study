# c-study

Exercises and study programs from my learning of the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).

I've posted in this repo source for some programs I built myself in my course for studying the language, and some that came from exercises from the books I read while studying, mainly [*Practical C Programming*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-c-programming/1565923065/).

I'm not sure about how useful they are, but if have just started learning C, you might find these useful to adapt and incorporate into your own programming. Therefore, I chose to release them under the GNU General Public License. Enjoy!

## Quality Warning

These are **alpha quality** software and should not be considered production-ready. They are the notebooks of a college student, that's a good analogy. Feel free to fix them with a pull request or issue, though.
